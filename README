WELCOME TO MY HSBC RECRUITMENT TASK.

You can run the application using main method in Application class. It based on spring boot so you dont need to use any external tools.
After application start go to below address in your browser:

http://localhost:8080/

You can find there couple methods for managing the employee repository. Put your data into inputs and execute by pressing the proper button.

In test and integration packages you can find couple basic tests. Not all scenarios are covered by tests but I hope that's enough for this task.
